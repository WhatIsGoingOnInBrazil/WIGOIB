1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,769
To explain what is going on in Brazil right
now is quite easy.

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:10,300
It is also easy to understand.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:21,380
Our President, Dilma Vana Rousseff, was elected
in 2014 with 54,501,118 votes.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:30,239
It is the fourth consecutive win for the Worker's
Party in the presidential election.

5
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,380
Previously, Luis Inácio da Silva, known as
Lula, also from the Worker's Party, lost the

6
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:44,570
presidential elections three consecutive times:
in 1989, 1994 and 1998.

7
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:54,660
Lula was elected in 2002, and re-elected in
2006. Dilma was then elected in 2010, and

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,240
recently re-elected.

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:05,220
At the same time, in 2014 people elected the
most conservative congressmen since the end

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,630
of Brazilian military dictatorship.

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:15,740
Many of these Congressmen, through their action
in Congress, reveal that they act according

12
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:23,740
to the will of those who paid their campaigns
and now pay for their decision making. In

13
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:30,300
other words: they do not represent the will
of the people who voted on them; they represent

14
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,299
who pay them most.

15
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:41,760
In this scenario, we are witnessing the enacting
of an impeachment. The law enforces a series

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,960
of conditions for it to happen.

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,700
The Brazilian Constitution requires a criminal
act from the President. But Dilma has not

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,530
committed any crime.

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,479
In fact, it is quite the opposite: she is
well-known as "rigid" and "inflexible", truly

20
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,470
meaning that she is not open to illicit negotiations.

21
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:11,920
Even among her political enemies, Dilma is
known as being honest.

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,500
As there is no illegal act, common 
and ordinary administrative acts

23
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,050
were transformed into crimes.

24
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,300
Passionate, fraudulent discourses
are repeated exhaustively,

25
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,460
trying to assert that there is a crime.

26
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:37,920
While intensively pushed by the mainstream
media, these speeches do not stand a rational

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,840
and unbiased analysis, as they do not stand
to the facts.

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,890
There is no crime. At all.

29
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,640
There is no single act from the President
which can be pointed as evidence. Sincerely

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,099
speaking, there is no crime as there is no
intention of a crime.

31
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:04,010
This is why the process is being flagged as
a coup (a government overthrow): because the

32
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,459
Constitution requirements are not being respected.

33
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:15,420
What makes the situation outstanding is the
reason why these Congressmen are pushing this

34
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,200
injustice forward.

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Let me tell you: they are doing this as a
way to interrupt the course of current investigations

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,400
against corruption, which Dilma's government
promotes and support.

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:40,510
Yes, you heard right: criminal politicians
joined forces to enforce an end, or at least

38
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,790
a severe limit to the ongoing operations led
by the Federal Police and other legal institutions.

39
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:57,060
This utter madness would not have the minimal
chance to happen without strong support of

40
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,709
an amazing power: the mainstream media.

41
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:10,050
In Brazil, almost the entirety of the media
business is owned by a handful of families.

42
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:19,190
It is said that six families control 80% of
all media and publication channels.

43
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:28,940
This is why you need a citizen - not a company
- to tell you what is going on.

44
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:36,830
The media channels´ massive and expensive
apparatus is such that their distorted narrative

45
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,150
has been pushed into a significant portion
of the population, who has been tricked into

46
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:51,020
thinking that their version is the only existing
one, corresponding to the facts.

47
00:04:51,020 --> 00:05:01,919
In the next episodes many aspects and actors
of this drama shall be detailed, as well as

48
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:09,900
why and how the narrative of the mainstream
media is so disconnected from what is really

49
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,310
going on in Brazil.

50
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,920
