1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,120
In the first episode we talked about the basics
of what is going on in Brazil now: the honest

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,140
President - which supports actions against
corruption - is being casted out by the corrupt

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,349
politicians themselves, united.

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,920
How can such injustice happen?

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,800
We briefly mentioned the role of the mainstream
media on supporting a false perspective and

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,180
pushing it into a considerable slice of the
people.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,690
By completely ignoring the bigger and serious
issues, while focusing and targeting heavily

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,389
on minor issues, the mainstream media pretends
that the true reasons for the impeachment

9
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:45,870
do not exist or are not important.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:54,999
TRIPPING A COUNTRY UP
Dilma's impeachment is a big tragedy of huge

11
00:00:54,999 --> 00:01:02,109
proportions. It is very important to be aware
of what is really at stake.

12
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:08,270
It is not only a coup in a person. It is not
only a coup in the Workers Party. It is even

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,120
more than a coup in the whole left wing. It
is not only a coup in the democracy. It is

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,640
a coup in Brazil.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,900
And it is more than a coup in Brazil. It is
a coup in BRICS itself - the promising union

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:31,040
between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa. It is also a coup in all popular governments

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,270
in South America.

18
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,030
It is the meltdown of a nation's bright future.

19
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,230
Let's understand this better.

20
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,000
1. FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,740
Dilma's support to the undertaking of investigations
against corruption is not mere discourse or

22
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,690
hypocrisy. It translates into actions and
numbers.

23
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:05,270
The operations and prisons related to corruption
are at historical heights. Several laws have

24
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:12,349
been created to properly detect and punish
illicit usage of public money. The Police is

25
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,800
not blocked or censored by the government
in the accomplishment of their

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,860
investigative tasks.

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,999
With this positioning and a strong hold on
making justice, Dilma has attracted the bad

28
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:34,950
will of a giant and powerful country-wide
network of illicit fortune making.

29
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,739
Corruption in Brazil is a real and big issue.
Truly standing against it is a courageous

30
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,760
act by itself.

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:51,940
Nevertheless, 100% of all citizens and politicians
agree on this point. Everybody speaks

32
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,760
"against corruption", including those who practice
it.

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,859
It is easy for me and for you to be against
corruption. Dilma suffers the consequences

34
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:11,040
of being President and really being against
corruption. Not only in words, but also in

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
thoughts and actions.

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,849
2. POLITICAL REFORM

37
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:23,310
In 2013, we had several manifestations in
Brazil, when a considerable number of people

38
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,980
went to streets to protest for change.

39
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:33,040
Political Reform was Dilma's answer to the
clamour coming from the streets.

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,680
The meaning of the message was: with the current
political system, chances for meaningful and

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,549
significant transformation are very restricted.

42
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:51,419
The proposed political reform represents a
series of changes on how the representatives

43
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,980
of the people are chosen, as well as how the
policies to be implemented are elaborated

44
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,060
and decided.

45
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:08,180
The core idea is to make public policies more
influenced by the public. Increase popular

46
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:16,310
participation in decisions. A movement towards
opening and participation. Towards transparency

47
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,500
and collaboration.

48
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:26,120
At that time, the role of the mainstream media
was either ignore or discredit the political

49
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:34,320
reform as suggested by Dilma, focusing on
minor aspects of it. In social networks, it

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,750
has been accused as a periculous communist
attack.

51
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,850
In September 2014, around 500 organizations
in the whole country promoted a plebiscite

52
00:04:47,850 --> 00:05:02,660
to acknowledge people's support for a political reform 
in Brazil. From a total of 7,754,436 votes,

53
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:11,870
97% declared to be favourable for a political
reform. Around 7.5 million voted "yes".

54
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:22,290
This is a very expressive achievement. But
silence is one of the mainstream media weapons.

55
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:29,250
Just like effectively acting against corruption,
in the same manner, seriously supporting the

56
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,990
idea of giving more power to the people through
a political reform is a solid path to attract

57
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,620
a handful of powerful enemies.

58
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,190
It should be easy to understand that those
who reap benefits from the

59
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:52,240
current corrupt political system do not want true changes on it.

60
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,780
3. MEDIA DEMOCRATIZATION

61
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:06,970
In the Brazilian Federal Constitution, article
220, 5th paragraph, it is explicitly expressed:

62
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:14,510
privately owned communication channels in
the country cannot be object of monopoly or

63
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,000
oligopoly.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,380
To bring this single statement into reality
in Brazil would imply in dramatical changes

65
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,950
in the country's communications.

66
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:37,120
But this is only the tip of the iceberg: articles
220, 221, 222 and 223 paint a picture where

67
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,980
the media should translate the plurality of
voices that this rich country has.

68
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,530
Unfortunately, what we really have now here
is a powerful monolithic conglomerate which

69
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:59,150
tends to transform any dissonant voice into
ridicule - even if this voice is from the

70
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,460
Pope itself.

71
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,890
Raising the flag of bringing democracy to
communications resulted in unprecedent joint

72
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,120
of forces by the mainstream media against
Dilma's government.

73
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,280
Furthermore, the mainstream media depicts
the democratization initiative as censorship.

74
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:28,760
It is fairly the opposite: the democratization
aims to give voice to the unheard.

75
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,780
4. OIL AND EDUCATION

76
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:38,170
Each one of these can be seen as enough reason
for a government overthrow:

77
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,330
- true action against corruption,
- political reform support,

78
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,950
- media democratization

79
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:49,610
There is also another cause of concern for
the plutocracy who is driving the current

80
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,750
coup in Brazil. In one word: Education.

81
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,950
Ignorance is their strongest support.
Awareness is their true enemy.

82
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:07,000
Dilma's motto for her second mandate is: "Brazil,
Homeland of Education"

83
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:13,400
It is well-known in Brazil that due to Workers
Party governments, the country ended up removed

84
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,830
from the Hunger Map (which is a report made
by the United Nations).

85
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,580
After the successful accomplishment of this
basic first step - feeding the estomach - a

86
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,930
new goal was set: to feed people with knowledge
and culture.

87
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,289
This is a very expensive enterprise.

88
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,300
And this is where the oil factor comes in.

89
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:46,700
You may have heard about "pre-salt". The “pre-salt”
is an area of oil deposits found in deep saline

90
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:53,010
rock layer, which forms one of the various
rock layers in the seabed.

91
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:59,480
Ex-President Lula considered its discovery
in Brazil a God's blessing. The source of

92
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,330
money for the expensive enterprise of Education
in a continental-sized nation.

93
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:16,330
The value of pre-salt petroleum found in Brazilian
coast is estimated to be trillions of dollars.

94
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,790
Those interested in impeachment can easily
buy lots of Brazilian Congressmen with a tiny

95
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,940
fraction of this amount.

96
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:32,029
The intention of cheap selling this national
treasure for overseas companies has been explicitily

97
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:39,840
expressed. This intention is clearly stated
by Brazilian politicians in e-mail communications.

98
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:48,580
A few messages have been leaked in the internet
and, as usual, ignored by the mainstream media.

99
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:55,500
Brazil's strongest public company, the oil
giant Petrobrás, suffers a massive campaign

100
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:02,890
to burden its reputation. The goal is to transfer
it to private hands for the cheapest price

101
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,240
possible.

102
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:13,310
Again, the mainstream media plays a central
role. Citizens should be defending their treasure,

103
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:19,750
but they end up joining the media choir. They
promote the cheap sell as if the company had

104
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,660
been already stolen by the Workers Party.

105
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,160
While the fooled people is proud of "standing
against corruption", they are literally and

106
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,500
mercilessly killing the golden goose.

107
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,360
It is a shame that those elected and paid
by the people and for the people are making

108
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,779
themselves the destroyers of the education
and the resources of the own country.

109
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,490
5. BRICS

110
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:59,700
The single-handled and unchallenged financial
power behind the banks is geared towards one

111
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,580
thing: profit. This has been the sacred principle,
above all others.

112
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:11,710
When the creation of BRICS bank was announced,
it has been received as great news by many.

113
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:17,740
It has been perceived as if we would finally
begin to have some balance, by having a new

114
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,250
significant financial power geared towards
development.

115
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,800
BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa.

116
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,779
The national Brazilian mainstream media has
not given more than minimal attention to it.

117
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:40,680
Sincerely speaking, in Brazil, if you do not
have other reliable sources of information,

118
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:48,610
you are left in the dark. Even though you
consume news, you are left uninformed.

119
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:55,480
A coup in Brazil is also a coup in BRICS - weakening
this powerful coalition which has potential

120
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,149
to be effectively a global game changer.

121
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:04,149
THE SACRIFICE OF A BRIGHT FUTURE

122
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:10,740
In 2008, a global economical crisis was hitting
the world, but Brazil under the Workers Party

123
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,270
government didn't suffer a recession.

124
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:20,000
Similarly, in 2015, despite the catastrophic
tone of the media, Brazil was again going

125
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,120
through a severe global crisis with a reduced
impact and a positive perspective.

126
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,910
The government has not denied the existence
of a crisis and the necessity of adjustments,

127
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:37,170
which were done in 2015 and impacted negatively
the economy.

128
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,640
The perspective is to overcome it and start
growing again.

129
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,880
While the media focus exclusively in the crisis,
there are very positive and concrete aspects

130
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:53,980
of the current scenario: No hunger anymore.
Social inclusion. Steady increase of minimum

131
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,720
wage. World Cup. Olympics. Several new Federal
Universities. Big buildings - such as San

132
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,210
Francisco river transposition, Belo Monte
dam, railroads. And a bright Educational plan.

133
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:13,279
This and much much more is what is being thrown
away. We shall have an episode only to list

134
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,740
the good things going on, which are absolutely
"forgotten" by mainstream media.

135
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,250
It is also true that there is an economical
crisis going on right now. Despite all the

136
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,450
real issues the country still have to address,
none justify an impeachment.

137
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:39,670
Instead of help to fight it, impeachment supporters
take advantage of it: the worse is the situation,

138
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,080
the better, because government's popularity
decreases.

139
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,600
We should join forces in favour of the best
for the country's people.

140
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:58,170
Congress should foster solutions. Congress
is blocking them, instead. (We shall see more

141
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,150
details about it in future episodes.)

142
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,720
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE

143
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:11,610
Dilma has not committed any crime. The impeachment
is being forged by many reasons, and has many

144
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,040
coordinated actions and actors.

145
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,620
As we saw, the reasons include:

146
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,520
- true action against corruption
- support for a political reform

147
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,000
- end of media oligopoly
- trillions of pre-salt petroleoum

148
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,770
- Homeland of Education plan
- BRICS bank

149
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,750
- huge infra-structure investments

150
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,800
As a consequence, this brings the opposition
of:

151
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,520
- real corrupts and criminals
- career politicians

152
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,900
- mainstream media
- overseas oil companies

153
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,680
- all which profits on ignorance
- NATO, IMF, World Bank

154
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,770
- imperialist powers

155
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:06,500
As we can see, the amount of goodness is proportional
to the amount of powers and forces that joined

156
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,320
and acted against Workers Party's government,
supporting the current fraud of Dilma's impeachment.

157
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,180
We are currently hostages of
a criminal interim government.

158
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,980
We just want our legitimate government back.

159
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,880
