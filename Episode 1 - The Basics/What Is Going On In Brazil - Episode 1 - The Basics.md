To explain what is going on in Brazil right now is quite easy.

It is also easy to understand.

> Our President, [Dilma Vana Rousseff](https://www.facebook.com/DilmaRousseff), was elected in 2014 with [54,501,118 votes](http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/estatisticas/estatisticas-eleitorais-2014-resultado).

It is the fourth consecutive win for the [Worker's Party](https://www.facebook.com/pt.brasil) in the presidential election.

Previously, Luis Inácio da Silva, known as [Lula](https://www.facebook.com/Lula), also from the Worker's Party, **lost** the presidential elections three consecutive times: in 1989, 1994 and 1998.

Lula was elected in 2002, and re-elected in 2006. Dilma was then elected in 2010, and recently re-elected.

> At the same time, in 2014 people elected the most conservative congressmen since the end of [Brazilian military dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_military_government).

Many of these Congressmen, through their action in Congress, reveal that they act according to the will of those who paid their campaigns and now pay for their decision making. In other words: they do not represent the will of the people who voted on them; they represent who pay them most.

In this scenario, we are witnessing the enacting of an [**impeachment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment). The law enforces a series of conditions for it to happen.

> The [Brazilian Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Brazil) requires a criminal act from the President. But Dilma has not committed any crime.

In fact, it is quite the opposite: she is well-known as "rigid" and "inflexible", truly meaning that she is not open to illicit negotiations.

Even among her political enemies, Dilma is known as being honest.

> As there is no illegal act, common and ordinary administrative acts were transformed into crimes.

Passionate, fraudulent discourses are repeated exhaustively, trying to assert that there is a crime.

While intensively pushed by the mainstream media, these speeches do not stand a rational and unbiased analysis, as they do not stand to the facts.

> There is no crime. At all.

There is no single act from the President which can be pointed as evidence. Sincerely speaking, there is no crime as there is no intention of a crime.

This is why the process is being flagged as a [**coup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) (a government overthrow): because the Constitution requirements are not being respected.

-----

What makes the situation outstanding is the **reason** why these Congressmen are pushing this **injustice** forward.

> Let me tell you: they are doing this as a way to **interrupt the course of current investigations** against corruption, which Dilma's government promotes and support.

Yes, you heard right: criminal politicians joined forces to enforce an end, or at least a severe limit to the ongoing operations led by the Federal Police and other legal institutions.

This utter madness would not have the minimal chance to happen without strong support of an amazing power: [**the mainstream media**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/presstitute).

> In Brazil, almost the entirety of the media business is owned by a handful of families.

It is said that six families control 80% of all media and publication channels.

This is why you need a **citizen** - not a **company** - to tell you what is going on.

The media channels´ massive and expensive apparatus is such that their distorted narrative has been pushed into a significant portion of the population, who has been tricked into thinking that their version is the only existing one, corresponding to the facts.

In the next episodes many aspects and actors of this drama shall be detailed, as well as why and how the narrative of the mainstream media is so disconnected from **what is really going on in Brazil**.
