00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.769
To explain what is going on in Brazil right
now is quite easy.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.300
It is also easy to understand.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:21.380
Our President, Dilma Vana Rousseff, was elected
in 2014 with 54,501,118 votes.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.239
It is the fourth consecutive win for the Worker's
Party in the presidential election.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.380
Previously, Luis Inácio da Silva, known as
Lula, also from the Worker's Party, lost the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.570
presidential elections three consecutive times:
in 1989, 1994 and 1998.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:54.660
Lula was elected in 2002, and re-elected in
2006. Dilma was then elected in 2010, and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.240
recently re-elected.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:05.220
At the same time, in 2014 people elected the
most conservative congressmen since the end

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.630
of Brazilian military dictatorship.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.740
Many of these Congressmen, through their action
in Congress, reveal that they act according

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.740
to the will of those who paid their campaigns
and now pay for their decision making. In

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.300
other words: they do not represent the will
of the people who voted on them; they represent

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.299
who pay them most.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.760
In this scenario, we are witnessing the enacting
of an impeachment. The law enforces a series

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.960
of conditions for it to happen.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.700
The Brazilian Constitution requires a criminal
act from the President. But Dilma has not

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.530
committed any crime.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.479
In fact, it is quite the opposite: she is
well-known as "rigid" and "inflexible", truly

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.470
meaning that she is not open to illicit negotiations.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.920
Even among her political enemies, Dilma is
known as being honest.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.500
As there is no illegal act, common 
and ordinary administrative acts

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.050
were transformed into crimes.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.300
Passionate, fraudulent discourses
are repeated exhaustively,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.460
trying to assert that there is a crime.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.920
While intensively pushed by the mainstream
media, these speeches do not stand a rational

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.840
and unbiased analysis, as they do not stand
to the facts.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.890
There is no crime. At all.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.640
There is no single act from the President
which can be pointed as evidence. Sincerely

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.099
speaking, there is no crime as there is no
intention of a crime.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.010
This is why the process is being flagged as
a coup (a government overthrow): because the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.459
Constitution requirements are not being respected.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.420
What makes the situation outstanding is the
reason why these Congressmen are pushing this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.200
injustice forward.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.200
Let me tell you: they are doing this as a
way to interrupt the course of current investigations

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.400
against corruption, which Dilma's government
promotes and support.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:40.510
Yes, you heard right: criminal politicians
joined forces to enforce an end, or at least

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.790
a severe limit to the ongoing operations led
by the Federal Police and other legal institutions.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:57.060
This utter madness would not have the minimal
chance to happen without strong support of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.709
an amazing power: the mainstream media.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.050
In Brazil, almost the entirety of the media
business is owned by a handful of families.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:19.190
It is said that six families control 80% of
all media and publication channels.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:28.940
This is why you need a citizen - not a company
- to tell you what is going on.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.830
The media channels´ massive and expensive
apparatus is such that their distorted narrative

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.150
has been pushed into a significant portion
of the population, who has been tricked into

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.020
thinking that their version is the only existing
one, corresponding to the facts.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:01.919
In the next episodes many aspects and actors
of this drama shall be detailed, as well as

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:09.900
why and how the narrative of the mainstream
media is so disconnected from what is really

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.310
going on in Brazil.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.920
Thank you for listening.
