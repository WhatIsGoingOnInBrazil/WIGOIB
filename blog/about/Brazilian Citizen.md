**J Bruni**, abbreviation for **João Henrique de Andrade Bruni**, was born in [December 5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_5) [1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978), in [Araraquara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araraquara), state of [São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sao_Paulo_state), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil).

### Education

Very soon, with just one week of life, he moved to [São Paulo city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sao_Paulo), the capital of the state, and there he grew up.

As a brilliant student, always one of the bests in his classroom, he went through all primary and secondary school, entering University in the early age of seventeen.

#### Technical College

J Bruni studied Computer Sciences at "Escola Técnica Estadual São Paulo" ("São Paulo State Technical School"), from 1993 to 1995.

Some remarkable things from that period:

- The news that the first Intel Pentium chip was released, for sale at the price of US$9,000.00!

- In an occasion which there was no teacher available for the "programming" discipline, J Bruni himself gave classes to his fellow colleagues.

- His first remunerated jobs, mainly the one at [USP (University of São Paulo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sao_Paulo), in 1995, where he started using internet, when it was unknown to most people in Brazil.

#### University

J Bruni graduated as an "Audiovisual Producer", by taking the "Image and Sound (Arts)" superior course at [Federal University of São Carlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Sao_Carlos).

- The video-performance "*persona comigo*" was produced by him and presented at the very first semester. Two televisions talked to each other, through characters playing in each one, and there was also an interaction with a live human character. Among other interesting scenes, the most remarkable one was that in which the human character talks with himself in the television, and the television character ironically answers to the human: "the reality is inside here"...

- The video "*The End of Time*", educational documentary about the [Maya calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar) and the thirteen moon calendar, was produced as course conclusion work.

- Even though "*Image and Sound*" is a Humanities graduation course, conducted by the Department of Arts of the University, it has an interesting mix of disciplines, covering the three main folds of **Art**, **Technology** and **Market** (idea, production and sales).

### Languages

- [**Portuguese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese) is J Bruni´s mother language. It´s remarkable that in the age of 10, he was the only one in his classroom to spell correctly the word "exceção" (exception) in a dictation (becoming, in fact, an "exception"). (This word is really difficult in portuguese.)

- [**English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English) is J Bruni´s second language, as he can read and listen to it very well, and also write, as you can see in this article (wrote by him, despite third person voice). Speeching is also very good, but since he lives in Brazil and cannot practice it a lot, he expects to improve this skill very soon with due practice.

- [**Spanish**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish): For many brazilians, including J Bruni, it is very easy to read in Spanish due to the great similarity between Spanish and Portuguese languages. But the ease ends there: with no practice and study, it is not possible to write, listen or speech in this language correctly. With some effort, one can make himself understood, though.

- [**Deutsch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch) (German): J Bruni learned a little bit of this language, since his mother´s profession was German language teacher.

- [**Nihon-go**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_go) (Japanese): Fascinated by that amazing and strange "hieroglyphs", J Bruni´s curiosity lead him to take some classes (3 semesters) of Japanese, and learn how to read and write in [Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana) and [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana), and also some basic [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji).

### Early Professional Experience

#### IEE-USP

Eletrotechnic and Energy Institute from the University of São Paulo. J Bruni worked there from january to july 1995. His service was to take care of the network and personal computers, giving support for all staff from the various buildings of the Institute, and also to develop new pieces of software.

#### Pixel informática

Small software-house, owned by J Bruni´s ex-teacher, which called him to work in his new business. Staying there for only two months (July-August 1995), Bruni learned to work with [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Delphi), recently released by [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland). He got out from this job due to family pressure, asking for him to concentrate on studies.

#### Condex informática

Small software-house located in Goiânia. Its main product is "Condex Gerencial" ("Condex Management"), a commerce automation system, most used for [*point-of-purchase*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_purchase) sales. As a programmer, J Bruni made maintenance and improvements on their software, during the short period he worked there, from January to March 2006. Again, 10 years later, the tool used was [Borland Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Delphi).

### ...plus a decade later...

The auto-biographical snippets above have been written by me in early 2007.

There is much more story before and after that.

Basically, since I got married in late 2006, we had two sons, and I've kept working as a software developer.

The [***What Is Going On In Brazil***](https://whatisgoingoninbrazil.com) endeavour aims to offer the point of view of a Brazilian Citizen regarding what is currently going on around here.

While all publications from the mainstream media are tied to the tiny scope of what their owners allow to be published, here you will find the narrative from someone who is free from this specific shackle.

Here you will find the perspective of a conscious citizen.
