> I now contemplate the fact that infinite intelligence dwells within me. There is a universal goodness, which is everywhere active and present: I am one with God, with life, the universe, and with all things. The action of God is taking place now in all of my affairs. I am prospered in mind, body, and affairs. I understand the law of life is one of progression; I am growing spiritually in a wonderful way. I am in tune with the infinite, and God is my partner. Success is mine now, for I am identified with success and prosperity. I rejoice to see all men grow righteously. I rejoice in the success of all. The spirit of goodwill flows from me to all mankind. I am full of confidence and peace. I am illumined by the Light within me. Divine understanding is a lamp unto my feet, and underneath are the everlasting arms.
